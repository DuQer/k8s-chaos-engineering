# Grafana Dashboards for Kubernetes Monitoring

This folder contains custom Grafana dashboards designed to monitor your Kubernetes cluster, including key metrics for Nodes, CPU, Memory, Disk Usage, Network I/O, and more.

## Dashboards

- **Node Overview**: A full overview of node performance (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network).
- **Cluster Metrics**: Metrics for Node CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network throughput, and errors.

## Notes

- These dashboards assume you have **Prometheus** and **Node Exporter** configured in your environment.
