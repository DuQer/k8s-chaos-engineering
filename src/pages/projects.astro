        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Task Manager</h2>
        <p class="flex-grow">Task Manager is a straightforward, RESTful application designed for efficient task management. It allows users to create their accounts and effectively manage their tasks. The application needs a Postman to work. The task manager uses the JWT token for authorization, which is returned in Postman when creating a new user. The user sends JSON with the necessary information and access token (in header) to a given endpoint and receives a response from the API.</p>
